5. Handle Special Cases
For pages that need custom breadcrumb labels (like employee names), you can pass props or use context. Here's an example for the employee detail page:

In src/app/(dashboard)/hr/employees/[id]/page.js:

jsx
import Breadcrumb from '@/components/common/Breadcrumb';
import CustomBreadcrumb from './components/CustomBreadcrumb';

export default async function EmployeeDetail({ params }) {
  // Fetch employee data
  const employee = await getEmployee(params.id);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <CustomBreadcrumb employeeName={employee.name} />
      {/* Page content */}
    </div>
  );
}
Create src/app/(dashboard)/hr/employees/[id]/components/CustomBreadcrumb.js:

jsx
'use client';

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation';
import Breadcrumb from '@/components/common/Breadcrumb';

const CustomBreadcrumb = ({ employeeName }) => {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  
  // Override the default breadcrumb label for the current path
  const customLabels = {
    [pathname]: employeeName
  };
  
  return <Breadcrumb customLabels={customLabels} />;
};

export default CustomBreadcrumb;
Why This Approach is Best
No Additional Dependencies: Uses Next.js capabilities without adding new libraries

Customizable: You can easily customize the appearance and behavior

Dynamic Routing Support: Handles dynamic routes like [id] effectively

Performance: Lightweight solution with minimal overhead

Maintainable: Centralized configuration for route mappings

Styling with Tailwind
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes, but you can customize them to match your design system. You might want to add responsive behavior or different styles based on your theme.

This implementation gives you a flexible, maintainable breadcrumb system that works with your existing project structure.
